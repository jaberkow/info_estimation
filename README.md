# info_estimation
A set of scripts to estimate the information transmitted in a multi-unit neural recording.  Most functions are wrappers around functions provided by the [pyentropy package](https://github.com/robince/pyentropy).

The functionality is mostly contained in [data_cleaning_utilities.py](https://github.com/jaberkow/info_estimation/blob/master/data_cleaning_utilities.py), and documentation within.
